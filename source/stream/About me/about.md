## Background

I currently live in Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province.

From 2003 to 2021, I lived in Hefei, Anhui province, attracted by the beautiful Qianchuan Mountains and the technology industry on the west bank of Chaohu Lake. In 2019 and 2020, I experimented with the digital nomadic life, traveling around China, working. Then in 2020, just before COVID, I settled in Lujiang County, Hefei City.

I have lived in Hefei for most of my life. I was born in Ketan Town, but lived in Hefei Lujiang Experimental High School for most of my middle school years, and finally attended Hefei Lujiang High School. I completed my college studies at Qinhuangdao Campus of Northeast University in Qinhuangdao, Hebei Province.
